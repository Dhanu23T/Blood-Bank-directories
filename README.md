# EDA on Blood-Bank-directories

*In an era where timely access to blood is critical, the Blood Bank Directory Analysis stands as a vital initiative.* <br>
In this project I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Blood Bank directories using SQL for data extraction, transformation, and querying.
Dataset taken from Open Government Data Platform <data.gov.in>.
* **SQL**<br/>
Using MySQL raw dataset is meticulously processed to unveil strategic insights, including state-wise blood bank distribution, identification of capacity limitations, and categorization based on ownership (charity, government, private). <br>SQL is instrumental in assessing critical facilities, such as blood component availability, apheresis services and defining functional status.
* **Power BI**<br/>
The analytical results are seamlessly integrated into Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool, to create dynamic and visually compelling dashboards. Power BI's capabilities in data visualization and exploration enhance the interpretability of key metrics, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.<br>
*The combination of SQL and Power BI forms a robust technical framework for dissecting and optimizing India's blood donation ecosystem.*
